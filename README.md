You need to install dependencies for all three sub-projects. Open your terminal at the project root and run:

### A. Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### B. Dashboard Frontend (Campus Buddy)
```bash
cd ../campus-buddy-fe
npm install
```

### C. Landing Page / Host (Intro FE)
```bash
cd ../intro-fe
npm install
```

then, run command 'npm run dev' for all A, B and C
